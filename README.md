# Skahal.Infrastructure.Framework.Repositories
Infrastructure framework for Repositories used in our games and apps.

This is a fork from a peace of https://github.com/skahal/Skahal.Infrastructure.Framework in order to split it in several small parts. Easier to maintain and easier to use.

Skahal.Infrastructure.Framework.Repositories is the lib with the basic definition to create repositories with Unit of Work.
I also contains a memory reposity that is amazing for bootstraping an App and facilitates the testing.
